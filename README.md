# Loanset_ML_Predictive_Analytics

Three major objectives of this work is to find classification models that are suitable for addressing the loans that will eventually be repaid or that goes into collection. In this regard, first objective is achieved by utilizing several popular MI algorithms like logistic, knn, decision tree and random forest classifiers, naive Bayes algorithms. 

Second objective is to utilize pycaret, a collection of  ML algorithms ( including those obtained in the first objective) that can automatically compute the metrics as obtained like the first objective. Purpose of this work is to compare if the metrics obtained from pycaret are comparable to those obtained from first objective, which will demonstrate pycaret to apply best fitting parameters. 

Third objective is to use MS-Azure to find best fitting parameters. 

Based on this, overall objective is to find best tool to address similar financial questions using Machine Learning in the future. 

PS: Please note: Second and third objectives are currently being planned and the repository will be updated as the tasks are accomplished.
